# Titanic Dataset Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
## Overview
This repository contains code for Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset. The Titanic dataset is a classic dataset used for machine learning and data analysis, containing information about passengers on the Titanic, including whether they survived or not.
## Objective
The primary objective of this project is to conduct a thorough EDA to gain insights into the dataset. Through visualizations and statistical analysis, we aim to understand patterns, relationships, and trends within the data, which can inform subsequent modeling and decision-making processes.
## Dataset
The dataset includes the following key features:<br>

Survived: Survival status (0 = No, 1 = Yes)<br>
Pclass: Ticket class (1 = 1st, 2 = 2nd, 3 = 3rd)<br>
Sex: Gender of the passenger<br>
Age: Age of the passenger<br>
SibSp: Number of siblings/spouses aboard<br>
Parch: Number of parents/children aboard<br>
Fare: Passenger fare<br>
Embarked: Port of embarkation (C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton)<br>
## Files
1)EDA.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook containing the EDA code and analysis.<br>
2)train.csv and test.csv : The Titanic dataset in CSV format.
## Analysis Highlights
1)Data Cleaning: Handling missing values, removing duplicates, and ensuring data integrity.<br>
2)Descriptive Statistics: Summarizing key statistics for numerical features.<br>
3)Visualizations: Creating visualizations (bar plots, histograms, etc.) to explore relationships and distributions.<br>
4)Feature Engineering: Deriving new features to enhance model performance.<br>
5)Correlation Analysis: Understanding correlations between different features.<br>
6)Survival Analysis: Examining factors influencing survival rates.
## Dependencies
1)Python 3.9<br>
2)Jupyter Notebook<br>
3)Pandas<br>
4)NumPy<br>
5)Matplotlib<br>
6)Seaborn

### Feel free to explore, analyze, and build upon this EDA to extract valuable insights from the Titanic dataset.
